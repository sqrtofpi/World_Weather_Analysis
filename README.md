# Creating a Vacation Itinerary using Python API's



## Overview of the Project

Building upon the success of our recent work for the PlanMyTrip app; we have been asked to create code that will allow us to define weather preferences which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels using the Google Maps Places API. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will choose four cities of interest within the same country to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities will be created as well as a marker layer map.

## Summary of Results

With definitions entered for potential travel destinations meeting the temperature criteria of between 75 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit, our beta tester has settled upon an area in Western United States to plan the vacation itinerary. The following images have been created to illustrate the results:
